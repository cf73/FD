        text: 'The Harbeth company was founded forty years ago to commercialise the BBC’s loudspeaker R&D. A great start, but only the first step of our journey towards the perfect sound. Today’s Harbeth loudspeakers are much more transparent, more vivid, more dynamic, more open, and more real because the enabling technology – such as the exclusive RADIAL™ technology – has made that possible. We’ve incorporated every genuine advancement into the latest Harbeth speakers which are, as you’ll hear yourself, in the class of their own for natural sound.'

        text: 'Gravitating towards owning Harbeth speakers is often, we’re told, a personal journey made after other ultimately unsatisfactory choices. We understand, but there is a shortcut. When the desire to put music first, escaping to the furthest corners of the musical globe from the safety and comfort of your home becomes essential to your well being, please allow our dealers to demonstrate just how special the Harbeth experience is.'
