brief_product_blurb: 'A specially sourced high power input power connector resistant to up to 16A, provides an unthrottled input signal which is not burdened by the typically throttled 10A consumer grade input connectors, thus solving this “bottleneck” right at the source. An additional mechanical lock prevents that mains cable from accidentally being disconnected or loosened.'
